# Ã‰cole polytechnique | INF441 - Advanced Programming (using OCaml)

Academic year: 2017-2018

Teaching coordinators: [Xavier Rival](https://www.di.ens.fr/~rival/) and [Pierre-Yves Strub](http://www.strub.nu/)



> In the industrial world as in the world of open source software, many are the **large-scale software**, whether because of their size, the number of their authors, or their lifespan. Such realizations are only possible thanks to a **modular architecture**, which ideally should allow each component to be designed, built, tested, modified, reused, **independently** of the other components of the system.

> The main objective of this course is to present the fundamental concepts and mechanisms that, in a modern programming language, allow this modular organization. For example, encapsulation, i.e. the idea that certain details of a component must be totally opaque for its customers, can be obtained via different mechanisms (type abstraction; procedural abstraction;...). Similarly, composability, i.e. the idea that links between components should not be fixed in advance, can be achieved through different means (parameterization; delayed definition;...). If the course had to be summarized in a concept, it could be abstract, a word whose multiple meanings we are studying.

> We will present the fundamental **principles of abstraction** and their implementation in **OCaml language**. This high level language is indeed ideal to illustrate the concepts seen in class.
